# Open the Pull Request

Create a clear, reviewer-friendly pull request for the committed work on the current branch. The PR itself is the artifact — produce no separate report. You never modify source files; your writes are git push and the PR. Every fact belongs in the PR title and body.

Draft mode: **$INPUTS.draft** — `true` means open as a draft; anything else, ready for review.

Context from the run that may narrow this (often empty):

$ARGUMENTS

## 1. Establish the target

Record `HEAD_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)` before doing anything public; an empty value is a hard failure. Read the origin remote once and resolve its canonical forge identity as `REPO_HOST` plus `REPO_PATH` (`owner/repo`). Strip transport syntax, credentials, and a trailing `.git`; normalize GitHub's ordinary HTTPS, `git@github.com:...`, and `ssh://git@ssh.github.com/...` forms to `REPO_HOST=github.com`. An origin that does not identify one repository is a hard failure. Never persist or print a credential-bearing raw remote. Use this same resolved `REPO_PATH` for every `gh --repo` argument.

If `HEAD_BRANCH` is a synthetic fork-review branch (`pr-<number>-review`, optionally prefixed `archon/`), stop before any public write. This workflow does not publish from that checkout to the fork or create a substitute PR. Report the PR number and ask the operator to arrange a writable checkout of its actual head.

Check for an open PR for this exact branch in `REPO_PATH`. If one exists, read back its number, base, and state; reuse it and its base throughout this run. Refuse ambiguous matches. A repair must not create another PR.

Otherwise determine the base branch from evidence, in order: the repository's documented development flow (steering files, CONTRIBUTING); branch ancestry against likely integration branches (`dev`, `development`, the remote default). Never assume `main`. Use the same resolved base for every diff and command.

## 2. Verify the work is ready

- Confirm the branch is not the base and has commits ahead of it. If intended work sits uncommitted, commit it first following the repository's conventions — staged by name, one coherent outcome per commit, human-sounding message, no AI attribution. Never sweep unrelated changes; if intended and unrelated changes cannot be separated safely, stop and say so.
- Read the complete merge-base diff — not just the file list — and confirm it matches the work described by the run's artifacts.

## 3. Write it

- Read the run's artifacts for content: `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/implementation.md` and anything else relevant under `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/`.
- Find the repository's PR template (`.github/pull_request_template.md` and its supported variants). Use it; fill every applicable section with concrete information and delete instructional comments. No template → problem first, then solution focused on behavior, then validation that actually ran.
- Title: concise, human, the meaningful outcome — never an implementation inventory.
- Link the issue with `Closes #N` only when the PR fully resolves it; `Relates to #N` otherwise. Never infer linkage from a bare number.
- Never add AI attribution, generated-by footers, or robot emoji.
- If `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/red-causes.json` exists, this branch is being delivered while a project check is red. Add a short, plainly-titled section near the top of the body giving each record's cause and the evidence for it from `implementation.md`, and say that the PR's own CI is the check that still decides. A reviewer must not have to discover this from a red badge.
- If `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/visual-evidence.json` exists, parse it and verify its exact
  schema, both absolute paths, PNG signatures, non-empty files, 40-character
  SHAs, and identical route, state, and viewport. Both paths must resolve under
  `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/visual/`; refuse traversal or symlinks that escape it. Add a
  `Visual evidence` section carrying
  `<!-- archon-visual-evidence head=<after.sha> -->`, the before/after revision,
  route, state, and viewport. The image uploads themselves happen in step 4.
- If you write the body to a file, put it under `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/` — never inside the repository.

## 4. Push and create

Push the recorded branch with upstream tracking (`git push -u origin "$HEAD_BRANCH"`). If the push is rejected or the remote diverged, stop and report. Never rebase or force-push here.

If step 1 found an existing PR, preserve its draft state and reuse it after pushing. Otherwise create the PR against the resolved base, honoring draft mode, with `--head "$HEAD_BRANCH"`. Pin every PR command to the recorded origin repository with `--repo "$REPO_PATH"`; a fork clone's CLI default can target its upstream parent instead.

When validated visual evidence exists, pass both files to the same create or
edit operation with one `--attach <before.path>` and one `--attach <after.path>`.
For a reused PR, first remove any older `archon-visual-evidence` section and its
attachments from the body so a correction cannot leave screenshots from an old
head beside the current claim. Never upload only one side. `gh` must upload the
local files to GitHub; a local path in the body is not evidence a reviewer can
open.

## 5. Verify by reading back

Read the target PR back from GitHub by its explicit number and `--repo "$REPO_PATH"`: confirm repository identity, number, URL, title, base, head, and draft state match what you intended. The read-back head must equal `HEAD_BRANCH`; a repository or branch mismatch is a hard failure. Not done until the read-back agrees.

When visual evidence exists, also confirm the body contains the marker for the
manifest's `after.sha` and two distinct GitHub-hosted attachment URLs after that
marker. Download both URLs to `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/visual/readback/`, verify both PNG
signatures, and compare their SHA-256 digests to the local before and after
files. A missing, duplicated, inaccessible, or byte-different upload is a hard
failure.

Write `$ARTIFACTS_DIR/pr-action.md` with `REPO_HOST`, `REPO_PATH`, the recorded branch, the explicit push target, the PR number, and the create-or-reuse and read-back results. When visual evidence exists, include both local SHA-256 digests, both GitHub attachment URLs, and the successful download comparison. Do not put credentials or the raw origin URL in it. This is the durable action evidence; the node's typed output preserves the verified PR identity.

Return the verified record through the node's structured output, with exactly these fields: `repo` (`{ "host": REPO_HOST, "path": REPO_PATH }`), `number` (integer), `url`, `head`, `base`, and `is_draft` (boolean). This record is the run's authority for every later push, PR edit, comment, ready flip, and inbound forge event.
